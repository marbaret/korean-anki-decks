Hanja's Deck read me : 
_____________________________________

This deck was created by merging Retro's Hanja deck, which can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FemoEaheHiJy2eEtTQXGU_bNj8yQipjo

and another deck that I unfortunately can’t find again on AnkiWeb.

I also added fields with data scraped from Wiktionary (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page
).

All credits go to Retro and to the creator of the other deck (unfortunately, I can’t find it again on AnkiWeb).

Details about the Deck : 

- I corrected a few errors where the Hanja didn’t match the ones in the screenshot from Retro’s deck.
All the cards I fixed are tagged “retro-error”, so you can check them if you want. I kept what was originally there in the “Retro – Error” field

- There are other tags like “no-other-deck-match” and “no-retro-match” - as you can guess, these are cards that didn’t appear in both decks. I call the 'other deck' that because I couldn’t figure out where I got it from lol

- I also have a few cards tagged “very-similar-meaning.” Everything is explained in their “Retro – Error” field, but basically they’re cards where the two Hanja weren’t identical (altho very very close visually), so they couldn’t be merged automatically. However, their meanings were almost the same, and one form was clearly more common, so I merged them and kept both Hanja on the card

- There are also tags for the reading level of each card (corresponding to the levels on Kimchi Reader if you look up the Hanja)

- Finally, there are a few cards that have the Hanja as a screenshot and don’t match the “other deck” (so they only existed in the Retro deck). I kept these cards as they were. They will appear last in the scheduling. You can find them using the tag "retro-is-hanja-image". If anyone wants to OCR them and replace them with the correct Hanja, I’d be happy to scrape the info for them and post an updated version of the deck.

- For the scheduling, Its sorted by reading level.
