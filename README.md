### Grammar Deck

This deck has been created using the GitHub repo from **[Kimchi Reader's](https://kimchi-reader.app/) grammar section**.  

**I strongly encourage you to try out [Kimchi Reader](https://kimchi-reader.app/) !**  
It's the most amazing tool I've used to learn Korean and the best way to build a vocab deck using its sentence mining feature. There is a 2-week free trial, so honestly just give it a try.  

There is an amazing **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/abRkZ2hhSA)** with people who will help you if you have any questions.

**Disclaimer**

I am not the creator of Kimchi Reader, and the Grammar page was not originally created for learning purposes.

### Hanja Deck

This deck was created by merging **Retro's Hanja deck**, which can be found **[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FemoEaheHiJy2eEtTQGU_bNj8yQipjo)**  
and another deck that I unfortunately can’t find again on AnkiWeb.  

I also added fields with data scraped from **[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page)**.  

All credits go to Retro* and to the creator of the other deck.
